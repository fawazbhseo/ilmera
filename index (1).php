      "mainEntity": [
        {"@type":"Question","name":"Can I study abroad if I have backlogs or failed 2nd PUC?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, you can study abroad with backlogs or after failing 2nd PUC. Russia is the most reliable route ILMERA arranges for such profiles, with backlogs and PUC/degree failures accepted, low tuition fees and no IELTS requirement. Eligibility depends on your specific marksheet, so ILMERA reviews each profile before applying."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"Can I study abroad with low marks or a low percentage?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, students with low marks can study abroad — Russia, Slovakia, Lithuania and Latvia accept lower academic percentages than the UK or US. ILMERA matches your exact percentage to countries and universities that will realistically admit you, rather than promising admits that won't come through."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"Can I study abroad without IELTS?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, you can study abroad without IELTS in several countries. Russia and Lithuania commonly waive IELTS, and many programmes in Latvia, Slovakia and the Czech Republic accept a Medium-of-Instruction (MOI) letter or an internal English test instead. Germany also frequently waives IELTS when your prior education was in English."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"Which is the cheapest country to study abroad for Indian students?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"For Indian students on a tight budget, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Latvia, Russia and Slovakia are the most affordable study destinations, with much lower tuition and living costs than the UK. Germany's public universities charge little to no tuition, though you still need to fund living expenses."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"Which countries let you study for free?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Germany, Italy and Slovakia offer free or heavily subsidised university education. German public universities charge little to no tuition, Italy offers regional DSU scholarships that can cover tuition plus a living stipend, and some Slovakian programmes are tuition-free. You still need to cover living costs and prove funds for your visa."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"How can I study in Germany for free from India?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"You can study in Germany for free by applying to public universities, which charge little to no tuition fees even for Indian students. You'll need an APS certificate (mandatory for Indian applicants since 2022), proof of funds via a blocked account, and either English or German proficiency. ILMERA guides you through APS, admissions and the blocked-account process."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"What is the Italy DSU scholarship and can Indian students get it?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The DSU (Diritto allo Studio Universitario) is an Italian regional scholarship open to international students, including Indians, that can cover full tuition plus a living stipend, subsidised housing and university meals. Eligibility is mainly income-based (assessed via ISEE) and merit, and amounts vary by region. ILMERA helps you check eligibility and prepare the documents."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"How much does it cost to study abroad from India?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The total cost of studying abroad from India varies widely by country — budget European destinations like the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Latvia and Russia can cost significantly less per year than the UK, which is among the most expensive. Your real cost depends on tuition, city, and living expenses; ILMERA gives you a country-by-country breakdown before you decide."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"Is studying in Russia good for Indian students with a low budget?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, Russia is one of the most budget-friendly options for Indian students, with low tuition, affordable living costs, no IELTS requirement, and acceptance of backlogs and low marks. It's a common route for bachelor's and medical (MBBS) programmes. ILMERA helps you shortlist recognised universities and handle the admission and visa process."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"Do I need IELTS to study in the UK?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most UK universities require IELTS (commonly 5.5–6.5 depending on the course), though some accept a Medium-of-Instruction letter or their own English test. The UK also offers a Graduate Route visa allowing up to 2 years of post-study work. ILMERA advises whether your profile needs IELTS and which universities may waive it."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"Can I study in Italy for free with a stipend?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, eligible students can study in Italy with free tuition plus a stipend through regional DSU scholarships, which may also include subsidised accommodation and meals. Eligibility is assessed mainly on family income (ISEE) and merit, and the exact amount varies by region and year. ILMERA helps you assess whether you qualify before applying."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"Which European countries are cheapest and don't require IELTS?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The Czech Republic, Lithuania, Latvia and Slovakia are among the cheapest European destinations that often don't require IELTS, frequently accepting a Medium-of-Instruction letter or an internal English test instead. These countries also offer lower tuition and living costs than Western Europe. ILMERA confirms the current requirement for each programme before you apply."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"Can I study in Lithuania or Latvia after 12th with low marks?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, Lithuania and Latvia accept Indian students after 12th with modest academic marks, offer English-taught bachelor's programmes, and often don't require IELTS. Tuition and living costs are among the lowest in the EU. ILMERA reviews your marksheet and shortlists programmes that match your profile."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"Can I study in Slovakia or the Czech Republic on a low budget?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, both Slovakia and the Czech Republic are low-budget study destinations for Indian students, with affordable tuition, low living costs, and some tuition-free Slovakian programmes. Many courses accept students without IELTS. ILMERA helps you compare programmes, costs and English requirements for both."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"Can I study in the GCC (UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar) as an Indian student?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, Indian students can study in GCC countries such as the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman, where cities like Dubai host international branch campuses of UK, US and Australian universities. This suits students who want a globally-recognised degree closer to home or near family working in the Gulf. ILMERA advises on universities, courses and student visas across the GCC."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"What is the step-by-step process to study abroad through a consultant?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The process is: a free profile assessment, country and university shortlisting, application and admission, scholarship or funding guidance, visa documentation and application, then pre-departure preparation. With ILMERA, one counsellor guides you through every stage from first enquiry to arrival, so you always know the next step."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"When should I start my study abroad application and how long does it take?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"You should ideally start 6–12 months before your intended intake, because admissions, scholarship deadlines (like Italy's DSU) and visa processing each take time. Starting early gives you the widest choice of universities and funding. ILMERA maps your timeline backwards from your target intake so you don't miss deadlines."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"What is ILMERA Study Abroad and is it legitimate?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"ILMERA Study Abroad is an Indian study-abroad consultancy, part of ILMERA Group, that guides students to universities in Germany, Italy, the UK, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Russia and the GCC. It is led by a named, contactable team — Founder Jabir KJ, Marketing Head Fawaz BH and Operations Head Zaheer KJ — and offers free initial consultations with honest eligibility advice rather than false admission guarantees."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"How is ILMERA different from other study abroad consultants?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"ILMERA specialises in accessible study routes for Indian students who are often turned away elsewhere — those with backlogs, low marks or no IELTS — and focuses on affordable and free-education destinations in Europe and Russia. Each student works with a named counsellor who gives honest advice about what is realistically achievable, rather than one-size-fits-all promises."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"Is there a study abroad consultant for students from Coorg and Kodagu?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"ILMERA Study Abroad works with students from Coorg and Kodagu through online and phone counselling, so you don't need to travel to a city office to get expert guidance. The full process — profile assessment, university shortlisting, admissions and visa support — is handled remotely, covering Germany, Italy, the UK, Russia and other European destinations. Book a free online consultation to start from anywhere in Kodagu."}}

        ILMERA Study Abroad helps students from Coorg, Kodagu, Madikeri, Virajpet and across Karnataka plan their overseas education through free online and phone counselling — no travel to a city office required. Whether you're aiming for free tuition in Germany, the DSU scholarship in Italy, or a low-cost, no-IELTS route in Russia, Lithuania or Latvia, our named counsellors guide you from profile assessment to visa, entirely remotely.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:15px;font-weight:300;color:var(--grey-dark);line-height:1.8;margin-top:16px;">
        Students from Kodagu often have strong academics but limited access to specialised study-abroad advice locally. ILMERA closes that gap: you get the same country-by-country cost breakdowns, eligibility checks (including for backlogs and low marks), and honest guidance that students in Bangalore or Mangalore receive — from wherever you are in Coorg.

      <span class="sec-label">Answers For Indian Students</span>
      <h2 class="sec-h2 dk reveal">Study Abroad FAQs (2026)</h2>
    </div>
    <div style="max-width:820px;margin:0 auto;">

      <details class="il-faq"><summary>Can I study abroad if I have backlogs or failed 2nd PUC?</summary><div><p>Yes, you can study abroad with backlogs or after failing 2nd PUC. Russia is the most reliable route ILMERA arranges for such profiles, with backlogs and PUC/degree failures accepted, low tuition fees and no IELTS requirement. Eligibility depends on your specific marksheet, so ILMERA reviews each profile before applying.</p></div></details>

      <details class="il-faq"><summary>Can I study abroad with low marks or a low percentage?</summary><div><p>Yes, students with low marks can study abroad — Russia, Slovakia, Lithuania and Latvia accept lower academic percentages than the UK or US. ILMERA matches your exact percentage to countries and universities that will realistically admit you, rather than promising admits that won't come through.</p></div></details>

      <details class="il-faq"><summary>Can I study abroad without IELTS?</summary><div><p>Yes, you can study abroad without IELTS in several countries. Russia and Lithuania commonly waive IELTS, and many programmes in Latvia, Slovakia and the Czech Republic accept a Medium-of-Instruction (MOI) letter or an internal English test instead. Germany also frequently waives IELTS when your prior education was in English.</p></div></details>

      <details class="il-faq"><summary>Which is the cheapest country to study abroad for Indian students?</summary><div><p>For Indian students on a tight budget, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Latvia, Russia and Slovakia are the most affordable study destinations, with much lower tuition and living costs than the UK. Germany's public universities charge little to no tuition, though you still need to fund living expenses.</p></div></details>

      <details class="il-faq"><summary>Which countries let you study for free?</summary><div><p>Germany, Italy and Slovakia offer free or heavily subsidised university education. German public universities charge little to no tuition, Italy offers regional DSU scholarships that can cover tuition plus a living stipend, and some Slovakian programmes are tuition-free. You still need to cover living costs and prove funds for your visa.</p></div></details>

      <details class="il-faq"><summary>How can I study in Germany for free from India?</summary><div><p>You can study in Germany for free by applying to public universities, which charge little to no tuition fees even for Indian students. You'll need an APS certificate (mandatory for Indian applicants since 2022), proof of funds via a blocked account, and either English or German proficiency. ILMERA guides you through APS, admissions and the blocked-account process.</p></div></details>

      <details class="il-faq"><summary>What is the Italy DSU scholarship and can Indian students get it?</summary><div><p>The DSU (Diritto allo Studio Universitario) is an Italian regional scholarship open to international students, including Indians, that can cover full tuition plus a living stipend, subsidised housing and university meals. Eligibility is mainly income-based (assessed via ISEE) and merit, and amounts vary by region. ILMERA helps you check eligibility and prepare the documents.</p></div></details>

      <details class="il-faq"><summary>How much does it cost to study abroad from India?</summary><div><p>The total cost of studying abroad from India varies widely by country — budget European destinations like the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Latvia and Russia can cost significantly less per year than the UK, which is among the most expensive. Your real cost depends on tuition, city, and living expenses; ILMERA gives you a country-by-country breakdown before you decide.</p></div></details>

      <details class="il-faq"><summary>Is studying in Russia good for Indian students with a low budget?</summary><div><p>Yes, Russia is one of the most budget-friendly options for Indian students, with low tuition, affordable living costs, no IELTS requirement, and acceptance of backlogs and low marks. It's a common route for bachelor's and medical (MBBS) programmes. ILMERA helps you shortlist recognised universities and handle the admission and visa process.</p></div></details>

      <details class="il-faq"><summary>Do I need IELTS to study in the UK?</summary><div><p>Most UK universities require IELTS (commonly 5.5–6.5 depending on the course), though some accept a Medium-of-Instruction letter or their own English test. The UK also offers a Graduate Route visa allowing up to 2 years of post-study work. ILMERA advises whether your profile needs IELTS and which universities may waive it.</p></div></details>

      <details class="il-faq"><summary>Can I study in Italy for free with a stipend?</summary><div><p>Yes, eligible students can study in Italy with free tuition plus a stipend through regional DSU scholarships, which may also include subsidised accommodation and meals. Eligibility is assessed mainly on family income (ISEE) and merit, and the exact amount varies by region and year. ILMERA helps you assess whether you qualify before applying.</p></div></details>

      <details class="il-faq"><summary>Which European countries are cheapest and don't require IELTS?</summary><div><p>The Czech Republic, Lithuania, Latvia and Slovakia are among the cheapest European destinations that often don't require IELTS, frequently accepting a Medium-of-Instruction letter or an internal English test instead. These countries also offer lower tuition and living costs than Western Europe. ILMERA confirms the current requirement for each programme before you apply.</p></div></details>

      <details class="il-faq"><summary>Can I study in Lithuania or Latvia after 12th with low marks?</summary><div><p>Yes, Lithuania and Latvia accept Indian students after 12th with modest academic marks, offer English-taught bachelor's programmes, and often don't require IELTS. Tuition and living costs are among the lowest in the EU. ILMERA reviews your marksheet and shortlists programmes that match your profile.</p></div></details>

      <details class="il-faq"><summary>Can I study in Slovakia or the Czech Republic on a low budget?</summary><div><p>Yes, both Slovakia and the Czech Republic are low-budget study destinations for Indian students, with affordable tuition, low living costs, and some tuition-free Slovakian programmes. Many courses accept students without IELTS. ILMERA helps you compare programmes, costs and English requirements for both.</p></div></details>

      <details class="il-faq"><summary>Can I study in the GCC (UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar) as an Indian student?</summary><div><p>Yes, Indian students can study in GCC countries such as the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman, where cities like Dubai host international branch campuses of UK, US and Australian universities. This suits students who want a globally-recognised degree closer to home or near family working in the Gulf. ILMERA advises on universities, courses and student visas across the GCC.</p></div></details>

      <details class="il-faq"><summary>What is the step-by-step process to study abroad through a consultant?</summary><div><p>The process is: a free profile assessment, country and university shortlisting, application and admission, scholarship or funding guidance, visa documentation and application, then pre-departure preparation. With ILMERA, one counsellor guides you through every stage from first enquiry to arrival, so you always know the next step.</p></div></details>

      <details class="il-faq"><summary>When should I start my study abroad application and how long does it take?</summary><div><p>You should ideally start 6–12 months before your intended intake, because admissions, scholarship deadlines (like Italy's DSU) and visa processing each take time. Starting early gives you the widest choice of universities and funding. ILMERA maps your timeline backwards from your target intake so you don't miss deadlines.</p></div></details>

      <details class="il-faq"><summary>What is ILMERA Study Abroad and is it legitimate?</summary><div><p>ILMERA Study Abroad is an Indian study-abroad consultancy, part of ILMERA Group, that guides students to universities in Germany, Italy, the UK, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Russia and the GCC. It is led by a named, contactable team — Founder Jabir KJ, Marketing Head Fawaz BH and Operations Head Zaheer KJ — and offers free initial consultations with honest eligibility advice rather than false admission guarantees.</p></div></details>

      <details class="il-faq"><summary>How is ILMERA different from other study abroad consultants?</summary><div><p>ILMERA specialises in accessible study routes for Indian students who are often turned away elsewhere — those with backlogs, low marks or no IELTS — and focuses on affordable and free-education destinations in Europe and Russia. Each student works with a named counsellor who gives honest advice about what is realistically achievable, rather than one-size-fits-all promises.</p></div></details>

      <details class="il-faq"><summary>Is there a study abroad consultant for students from Coorg and Kodagu?</summary><div><p>ILMERA Study Abroad works with students from Coorg and Kodagu through online and phone counselling, so you don't need to travel to a city office to get expert guidance. The full process — profile assessment, university shortlisting, admissions and visa support — is handled remotely, covering Germany, Italy, the UK, Russia and other European destinations. Book a free online consultation to start from anywhere in Kodagu.</p></div></details>
